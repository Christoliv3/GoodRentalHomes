Handling Frontend Routing
The next roadblock to tackle for setting up the frontend is routing.
If you’re planning to have the frontend do its own routing,
you’ll need to make sure that the backend routes don’t clash with the frontend ones.
You’ll also need to make sure that,
for all routes that the backend doesn’t recognize,
it falls back to rendering the layout page that bootstraps the frontend, and not a 404 page.
If you fail to do the latter,
nested frontend routes won’t work if you navigate to them directly,
or refresh the page after navigating from the root URL.

One way to ensure the routes don’t clash is to add a prefix like /app/ for web routes.
API routes already have the /api/ prefix set up by default, and shouldn’t pose any issues.
